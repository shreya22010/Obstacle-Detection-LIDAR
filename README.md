Obstacle Detection Using LIDAR Data Obstacle Detection Using LIDAR Data

This project was developed for the MIT Bangalore hackathon.
The aim was to process LIDAR sensor data to detect obstacles in the environment and determine their positions.

My Contribution

I worked on identifying and implementing Python functions to handle the data processing and detection steps. This included:

Reading and parsing LIDAR data

Filtering and cleaning the data for accuracy

Detecting the presence of obstacles based on distance thresholds

Outputting the detected obstacle positions

I created multiple working versions of the code so we could test slightly different approaches and compare results. This helped ensure the system could reliably detect obstacles under different conditions.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python

NumPy – for numerical computations and data handling

Matplotlib – for plotting and visualizing LIDAR readings

Math functions – for coordinate and distance calculations
