Obstacle Detection Using LIDAR Data

This project was developed as part of the MIT Bangalore Hackathon 2025 in the Robotics category.  
The main goal was to process LIDAR data and detect obstacles in a simulated environment with high accuracy.

Overview  
The system processes LIDAR sensor input, cleans and preprocesses the data, and then identifies obstacles in the path.  
It is designed to assist in autonomous navigation by providing real-time detection of obstacle positions.

Technologies Used  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- LIDAR datasets  

Repository Structure  
- scripts folder contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, detection, and visualisation.  
- Obstacle_Detection_Report.docx contains the complete documentation and results.  
- README.md contains the summary of the project.  

Project Report  
The complete documentation is available in the file Obstacle_Detection_Report.docx in this repository.

My Role  
I was responsible for collecting and cleaning the LIDAR datasets, developing parts of the obstacle detection logic,  
and contributing to the preparation of the project report.

Hackathon Context  
This work was part of the MIT Bangalore Hackathon 2025 under the Robotics category.
